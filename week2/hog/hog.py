    策略是一个函数，它接受两个总分作为参数（当前玩家的分数和对手的分数），

    为什么要这么实现？
    1. 高阶函数设计：always_roll是一个高阶函数，它返回一个策略函数
    2. 闭包机制：内部的strategy函数通过闭包捕获外部的参数n，这样每次调用strategy时都能访问到n的值
    3. 策略模式：这种设计允许创建不同的策略实例，每个实例都有自己固定的骰子数量
    4. 接口统一：所有策略函数都遵循相同的接口(score, opponent_score) -> int，便于在游戏中替换使用
    5. 参数化行为：通过传入不同的n值，可以创建不同行为的策略，而不需要写多个函数
